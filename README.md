# Bike Sharing Demand
This project aims to accurately forecast the number of ride-sharing bikes that might be used within any given 1-hour time-period. 
Bike-sharing programs are in demand, as the need for health-conscious activities that save the environment skyrockets. Our project aims to forecast the rental market for the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington DC. The forecast system can then be replicated by over 600 bike-sharing businesses globally to maximize profits.

# General Information
A bicycle-sharing system could be a program that allows people to borrow or use bicycles that are available for short-term shared usage for a fee or without charge. There are already more than 500 bike-sharing schemes operating worldwide. These programs often provide free or cost-effective methods to access bicycles for a short distance traveled within a geographic area in opposition to automobiles to bring down traffic and noise and air pollution that comes with it. For such systems, the number of users on any given day can vary substantially. By predicting numbers of hourly users, we can help save business and different other organizations, both private or government run these systems way more affordably and effectively. 

# Technologies Used
Python libraries: Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statmodels

# Setup
The project requirements/dependencies are listed in the import statements at the beginning of the code:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - sklearn
  - Statmodels

To set up your local environment and get started with the project, you need to follow these steps:

1. Install Python on your computer if you haven't already done so. You can download Python from the official website:https://www.python.org/downloads/.
   
2. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project files.

3. Clone the project repository using Git or download the project files directly from the repository.

4. Install the required dependencies by running the following commands in your command prompt or terminal window: pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn sklearn statmodels.

5. Once the dependencies are installed, you can open the Jupyter Notebook file containing the project code and run the code cells to execute the project.

# Features
  - Bike sharing has been steadily increasing on a yearly basis. Suddenly from 2011 to 2012 the demand jumped  by 66.7% indicating the increase in market size.
  - Peak hours are 8AM to 5PM which corresponds to typical work hours.
  - Temperature in Celsius has a major impact on determining the bike sharing demand.

# Usage
We can improve data collection mechanisms and utilize customer demographic information to provide dynamic pricing models. Travel data shows casual user are more likely to spend a longer time and travel lengthier thatâ€™s why electric bikes are more preferred.A dynamic pricing model could be utilized by way of charging them according to time spent on the bike, a registered user will spend short time but fixed daily that means fixed daily rental.We can use location data to reduce supply chain insufficiencies and making sure that there is abundant supply of bikes on different locations. 

# Project Status
Project is: Complete
